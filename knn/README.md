# K-nearest neighbors

Steps to build Music Genre Classification using KNN:

1. Define a function to get the distance between feature vectors and find neighbors
2. Identify the nearest neighbors
3. Define a function for model evaluation
4. Extract features from the dataset and dump these features into a binary .dat file “my.dat”
5. Train and test split on the dataset
6. Make prediction using KNN and get the accuracy on test data

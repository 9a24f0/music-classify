# Music Genre Classification

The project is attempt to classify music genre using 4 approaches:
- Multiclass support vector machines (MSVM)
- K-means clustering (KMC)
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
- Convolutional neural networks (CNN)

## Data set
The dataset being used in this project is [GTZAN Genre Collection](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html).

> The dataset consists of 1000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long. It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks. The tracks are all 22050Hz Mono 16-bit audio files in .wav format.

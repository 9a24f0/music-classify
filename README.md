# Music Genre Classification

The project is attempt to classify music genre using 4 approaches:
- Multiclass support vector machines (MSVM)
- K-means clustering (KMC)
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
- Convolutional neural networks (CNN)

## Data set
The dataset being used in this project is [GTZAN Genre Collection](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html).

> The dataset consists of 1000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long. It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks. The tracks are all 22050Hz Mono 16-bit audio files in .wav format.

## Methods
### Multiclass support vector machines

### K-mean clustering

### K-nearest neighbors
`folder : /knn`

K-Nearest Neighbors is a popular machine learning algorithm for regression and classification. It makes predictions on data points based on their similarity measures i.e distance between them. The KNN algorithm uses ‘feature similarity’ to predict the values of any new data points. This means that the new point is assigned a value based on how closely it resembles the points in the training set.
